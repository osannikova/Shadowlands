                        the highest duty of all—carrying souls to the Shadowlands. Amongst Bastion’s gleaming spires and sweeping vistas await challenges
                        to test the mettle of the steadfast kyrians. <br>
                        Bastion is one of the ruling realms of the Shadowlands, ruled by the Kyrian Covenant.
                        It is a kingdom of pristine spires and crystalline skies, a land of elysian vistas, resplendent skies, gleaming spires,
                        and ethereal sights, ordered and purposeful. <br>
                        Souls naturally drawn to service are sent here by the Arbiter to examine their lives, cleanse themselves of their burdens,
                        and work toward a state of virtue so they might ascend to serve the Shadowlands as kyrian—messengers, 
                        couriers, and some of the purest souls in the realm of the dead. Fresh arrivals to Bastion will become 
                        kyrian Aspirants—wingless beings who train for eons to one day earn their wings and join the ranks of the Ascended. <br>
                        Bastion is the residence of Uther the Lightbringer's spirit.</p>
